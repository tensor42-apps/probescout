# Markdown files location

Any `.md` file that gets created MUST be placed inside:

**`/home/vlabs/tensor42/t42/probescout/development/dev/app/wiki/docs/`**

Do not create new markdown files under `backend/`, `frontend/`, or elsewhere in the repo unless they are the explicitly allowed harness or config docs (e.g. `harness_rules/*.md`). For new documentation, notes, or any other .md content, use the wiki docs path above.
