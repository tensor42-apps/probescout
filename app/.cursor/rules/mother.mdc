# Mother rule

Follow all rules defined in **dev/app/backend/harness_rules/** and **dev/app/frontend/harness_rules/**.

When making changes or adding features:
- For backend work: read and apply every rule file in `dev/app/backend/harness_rules/` (MOTHER.md, md-files-location.md, conventions.md, backend-authority.md).
- For frontend work: read and apply every rule file in `dev/app/frontend/harness_rules/` (MOTHER.md, md-files-location.md, conventions.md).
