# Product name: ProbeScout

**ProbeScout** is the product name for this AI-driven, bounded reconnaissance agent (single-target nmap, backend-controlled). The name combines “probe” (discovery, recon) and “scout” (bounded exploration).

- **Tagline (UI):** "AI-driven single-target recon. Backend drives all steps."
- **Browser title:** "ProbeScout — AI-driven recon"

Use "ProbeScout" in the frontend, docs, and any user-facing copy. Internal/code references (e.g. repo name, implementation_design) may still say "agentic nmap" or "AI-Agentic Nmap" where that clarifies the architecture.
